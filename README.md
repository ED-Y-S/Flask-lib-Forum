**This project is a rather basic but an integral process of webpage UI designs and system deigns: the combination of SQL, HTML, CSS, and Python (FLask lib).**

**1.At current state, the forum is rather basic with the function of registering, login, and posting messages. At this moment, I am working on functions of deleting comments, image posting, replying, and comment displaying by pages, and various visual optimizations.**

**__Side Note__: I have implemented SQL and HTML injection preventions to the website.**
